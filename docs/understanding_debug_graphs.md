# How to interpret the debug graphs

The layout of the debug files produced in ~/.ros is as follows:

1 ``t_arrival``  The host wall clock time when the packet arrived
2 ``t_image``    The image timestamp, as generated by the free running camera clock
3 ``t_camera``
4 ``t_frame``    The time with which this frame is ultimately time stamped with
5 ``offset``     The time-average of:  ``t_arrival - t_frame``
6 average_dt
7 num_frames
