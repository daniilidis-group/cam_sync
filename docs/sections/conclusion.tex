\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we show how synchronized camera images from a
multi-camera system can be reliably associated
with the synchronization pulses that triggered them. Our method
performs well under high jitter and does not require synchronized camera clocks. We
provide implementation details and demonstrate how this method works
for a multi-view system of 8 GigE cameras. The described algorithm is
implemented in CamSync, an open source ROS node available at 
\href{https://github.com/daniilidis-group/cam_sync}{https://github.com/daniilidis-group/cam\_sync}.
